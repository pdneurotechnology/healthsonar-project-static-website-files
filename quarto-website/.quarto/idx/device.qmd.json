The former is related to thorax and abdomen oscillations for the extraction of heart and respiration rate, while the latter is related to walking, and generally to body motion.\nHealthSonar is an IoT device, transmitting data directly to the cloud application where personalized machine learning methods are used to analyze them, although it can also be connected to the HealthSonar mobile app to transmit data in real time and provide health-related measures to the users.\n\nThe basic principle of operation of the HealthSonar device lies in very low-power radio waves that detect, both the body movement and the subtle oscillations caused by the lungs and the heart.\nAn intelligent unit analyzes the captured data and extracts health-related parameters, while also detecting falls.\nA mobile app pairs with the HealthSonar device, configures and manages the system, while presenting information to the users."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"device.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":"cosmo","page-layout":"full","title":"Device"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
