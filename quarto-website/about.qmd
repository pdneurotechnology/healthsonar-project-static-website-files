Several groups of people face problems in their daily life related to their sleep or movement, resulting in reduced quality of life.
Some of those groups consist of, elders, patients with sleep disorders, patients with Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis or other neurological and movement disorders.

The HealthSonar project is aiming to develop a system based on ultra-low energy, ultra-wideband (UWB) radio technology, to monitor sleep, gait and indoor activity, including falls.

The device is meant to be used to monitor a person during sleep, in order to identify sleep-related events and assess sleep quality.
Moreover, during daytime, it can be used to extract gait parameters and identify falls.
