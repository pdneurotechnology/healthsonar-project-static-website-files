The Department of Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics offers a broad-based education for engineering, encompassing professional disciplines associated with current and future needs as well as with developments in both Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering.
It was founded in 1967, providing curricula in Mechanical Engineering since 1972, on a five-year course basis and preparing graduates for industry, government, education and research both at home and abroad.
Since 1995 the Department has been expanded and started offering curricula in Aeronautics in both undergraduate and post-graduate levels.
The Department covers a variety of career objectives sought by its graduates, leading to a Diploma degree, equivalent to the MS of Engineering, after a five- year study and the successful accomplishment of a Diploma Thesis, equivalent to Masters Thesis.
