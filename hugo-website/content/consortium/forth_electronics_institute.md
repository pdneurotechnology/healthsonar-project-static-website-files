The Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser of the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (IESL-FORTH) was founded in 1983.
It has since established its international presence in the areas of Laser Science, Micro/nano-electronics, Polymer Science, Materials Science and Astrophysics.
Nowadays, IESL occupies a distinct position in the international scientific map in several of these fields.

Our motivation is:

To perform high quality basic and applied research.
To develop expertise in selected advanced technological fields and to exploit this either via sales of specialized innovative products and services or via the transfer of knowledge and expertise for the benefit of Greek and European industry and the broader public sector.
To provide education and training to young scientists in specific fields of advanced technology as optoelectronics, micro/nano-electronics, materials science & engineering as well as laser science & applications.
